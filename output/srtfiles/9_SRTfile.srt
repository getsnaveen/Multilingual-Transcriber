0
0.0 --> 1.0
What are you talking about?

1
2.0 --> 4.0
You said yesterday and now they are asking you to come.

2
4.0 --> 6.0
Every fool has a day to come.

3
6.0 --> 8.0
Today is your day.

4
8.0 --> 10.0
If they ask you to come, I will let you come.

5
12.0 --> 14.0
I called you out of coverage.

6
14.0 --> 15.0
I inquired you.

7
15.0 --> 17.0
I told you about the auto station.

8
17.0 --> 19.0
If you don't come this time, the doctor will come.

9
22.0 --> 24.0
How do you know that there is a doctor inside?

10
24.0 --> 25.0
Hey, where are you?

11
25.0 --> 27.0
Stop talking and lift your head.

12
30.0 --> 31.0
I will tell you.

13
37.0 --> 38.0
Hey!

14
38.0 --> 39.0
Hey!

15
39.0 --> 40.0
What happened to that doctor?

16
40.0 --> 42.0
He scolded you by your name.

17
42.0 --> 44.0
Now he is like the president of your fan association.

18
44.0 --> 46.0
He is writing banners and tearing papers.

19
46.0 --> 47.0
Relax!

20
47.0 --> 50.0
If you kidnap his son, he will not react.

21
50.0 --> 51.0
Did you kidnap him?

22
51.0 --> 52.0
Yes.

23
52.0 --> 53.0
He is the one.

24
55.0 --> 56.0
He is Yalu.

25
57.0 --> 58.0
Sir, sir, sir, waiting.

26
58.0 --> 59.0
Your son.

27
59.0 --> 60.0
I am bringing him.

28
60.0 --> 62.0
The doctor is killing him.

29
62.0 --> 63.0
Come, Swami.

30
65.0 --> 66.0
Come.
