1 
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:1,000 
 What are you talking about? 

2 
00:00:2,000 --> 00:00:4,000 
 You said yesterday and now they are asking you to come. 

3 
00:00:4,000 --> 00:00:6,000 
 Every fool has a day to come. 

4 
00:00:6,000 --> 00:00:8,000 
 Today is your day. 

5 
00:00:8,000 --> 00:00:10,000 
 If they ask you to come, I will let you come. 

6 
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000 
 I called you out of coverage. 

7 
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000 
 I inquired you. 

8 
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000 
 I told you about the auto station. 

9 
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000 
 If you don't come this time, the doctor will come. 

10 
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000 
 How do you know that there is a doctor inside? 

11 
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000 
 Hey, where are you? 

12 
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000 
 Stop talking and lift your head. 

13 
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000 
 I will tell you. 

14 
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000 
 Hey! 

15 
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000 
 Hey! 

16 
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000 
 What is wrong with that doctor? 

17 
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000 
 He scolded you by calling your name. 

18 
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000 
 Now, he is like the president of your fan association. 

19 
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000 
 He is putting up banners and tearing papers. 

20 
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000 
 Relax. 

21 
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000 
 If you kidnap his son, he will not react. 

22 
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000 
 Did you kidnap him? 

23 
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000 
 Yes. 

24 
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000 
 He is the one. 

25 
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000 
 Yalu, tell him to leave. 

26 
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000 
 Sir, sir, waiting. 

27 
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000 
 Your son. 

28 
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:0,000 
 I am bringing him. 

29 
00:01:0,000 --> 00:01:2,000 
 The doctor is killing him. 

30 
00:01:2,000 --> 00:01:3,000 
 Come, Swami. 

31 
00:01:5,000 --> 00:01:6,000 
 Come.
